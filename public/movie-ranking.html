<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p> I love Batman Movies, but the depiction of the Joker in this movie, along with seeing Batman moral values pushed, was juts amazing and thrilling.</p>

<h3>Ice Age</h3>
<p>There are many great animated movies out there, but this one gives me the most nostalgia with memories from my childhood with my little brother.</p>

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>The best movie about a mob in the world, there is nothing to be said, just watch it.</p>
