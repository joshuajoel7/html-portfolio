<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Joshua Bermudez Cardona. As a professional I work as a Data Intelligence Specialist. Part of 
  what I enjoy about working with data is the research process, data collection, and then drawing conclusions from 
  all the information. Some of my more recent interests and what I'm trying to learn in my free time are about programming, 
  especially Java and Python languages. I usually go to work a bit later and leave later since I feel more productive at night,
  with fewer distractions, and it's something that has always happened to me since college.
  Although I have my days when I want to socialize with my colleagues or talk to clients and go in earlier to do so. </p>

<p>At one point, before joining my current workplace, I managed three projects and loved handling and working on them,
  which involved a team in Puerto Rico and another in Japan, giving me the opportunity to learn a lot about another culture's
 work style. I was also a supervisor during this period, which I enjoyed, and see it as a future goal to achieve again. </p>

<p>On a personal level, I like music and am taking piano lessons. I'm starting to draw and paint to relax after a day of work.
 I enjoy video games, anime, reading books, basketball, soccer, traveling, and spending time with family and friends. I go to 
  the gym, but generally, I like to engage in physical activities and try new sports whenever I have the opportunity. I always
  think it's good to have a coffee and a glass of wine one or two times a week. If you read all of this, I appreciate it and hope it
 is helpful in getting to know me a little.</p>
